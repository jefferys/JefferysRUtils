#' JefferysRUtils: My bag of tricks for R coding
#'
#' A collection of utilities that I use in R code. Each is too small to
#' warrant their own package, they are relatively unrelated, and depending on
#' them all as separate utility packages is too many dependencies for now. May
#' split some out later, so be warned.

#' These are useful for me. Your mileage may vary. Some are unfinished
#' and possibly broken
