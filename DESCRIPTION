Title: My bag of tricks for R coding
Version: 0.0.11
Author: Stuart R. Jefferys
Maintainer: Stuart R. Jefferys <srj@unc.edu>
Description: A collection of utilities that I use in R code. Each is too small to
   warrant their own package, they are relatively unrelated, and depending on
   them all as separate utility packages is too many dependencies for now. May
   split some out later, so be warned.
